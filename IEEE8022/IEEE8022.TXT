   IEEE 802.2 SAMPLE PROGRAM


   The IEEE 802.2 sample program is an example of an application
   program written to the dynamic link interface of IEEE 802.2.
   The function of the sample program is to communicate on a
   Local Area Network using IEEE 802.2 protocol.  In the sample
   scenario communication is set up between two IEEE 802.2
   partners on the Local Area Network; one partner sends data
   while the other receives the data.

   The sample program is designed to run only in protected
   mode of IBM Extended Services for OS/2.  The sample program
   source code and supporting files are provided for C.  The
   sample program can be compiled as a 16 bit application or
   a 32 bit application.  The 16 bit program is compiled with
   the Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 and runs on OS/2 SE Version
   1.30.1 or higher.  The 32 bit program is compiled with the
   the IBM C Set/2 Compiler and runs on OS/2 Standard Edition
   Version 2.0.


   PREREQUISITES

   To run the sample program, a user must obtain and be familiar
   with the following:

   1.  OS/2 installation and program execution

   2.  TOOLKIT installation

   3.  IBM Extended Services for OS/2 including Communications
       Manager Installation and Configuration

   5.  Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 (for 16-bit programs) or
       IBM C Set/2 Compiler (for 32-bit programs)


   HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

   Two PS/2 or AT machines which are connected to the same Local
   Area Network.  The network adapter must be one supported by
   IBM Extended Services for OS/2.  The adapter should be configured
   as adapter 0 or adapter 1.


   INSTALLATION

   The installation for running IEEE 802.2 sample programs consists of the
   following:

   1. Installing IBM Extended Services for OS/2 including
      Communications Manager.

   2. Creating the LAN Adapter and Protocol Support configuration file
      for the network adapter installed and IBM OS/2 IEEE 802.2 protocol
      for the sample program

   3. Installing TOOLKIT

   4. Installing the compiler selected


   ASSUMPTIONS

   The INSTALLATION DETAIL section explains the installation procedure.
   It is assumed that Extended Services, TOOLKIT and the compiler
   are installed on the same drive. For ease of discussion the C drive
   is used as the default.

   INSTALLATION DETAIL

   1. INSTALLING IBM EXTENDED SERVICES FOR OS/2

   Install IBM Extended Services for OS/2 according to the
   installation documentation provided with the product.
   When you install make sure you install LAN Adapter
   and Protocol Support.

   To build the IEEE 802.2 sample program, the Communications
   Manager API data structures must be installed on the build
   machine.  The API data structures are high level language
   include files.  To install the API data structures select them
   from the "Install Additional Features" panel.

   2. CREATING IEEE 802.2 SAMPLE PROGRAM CONFIGURATION FILE

   Use Communications Manager Advanced Configuration and
   select LAN Adapter and Protocol Support to configure
   the workstation.  Configure the network adapter
   driver for the network adapter installed and configure
   the IEEE 802.2 protocol driver for adapter 0 or 1.  The
   default configuration parameters for the network adapter
   driver are sufficient to run the sample program.  The
   SYSTEM KEY for IEEE 802.2 should be configured to 0xCFB0.
   The netaddress is used an input parameter to the sample
   program and can be configured for ease of recall.  It
   also can be discovered with a sample program option.


   4. INSTALLING TOOLKIT

   Install TOOLKIT using its installation procedure.


   5. INSTALLING THE COMPILER

   For the 16-bit application install Microsoft C Compiler
   Version 6.0 using the installation procedure for the compiler.
   For the 32-bit application install IBM C Set/2 Compiler
   using the installation procedure for the compiler.




   C SAMPLE PROGRAM 16 BIT APPLICATION

   The C sample program and the following instructions are
   for Microsoft C version 6.0.

   Set up the environment for the Microsoft C Compiler according
   to the compiler documentation. Create a subdirectory for the
   sample program.  Make sure the include path accesses the
   files in the toolkit.

   Copy the following into the sample program subdirectory from
   the sample program diskette:

        DLCSAMPO.C    - sample program source code
        DIRINTF.H     - sample program header file
        DLCERROR.H    - sample program header file
        DLCGBLV.H     - sample program header file
        DLCINTF.H     - sample program header file
        DLCSAM16      - 16 bit sample program make file
        DLCSAMPO.DEF  - sample program module definition file

   Copy the following Extended Services LAN Adapter and Protocol
   Support header files into the sample program subdirectory:

        LAN_1_C.H
        LAN_2_C.H
        LAN_3_C.H
        LAN_4_C.H
        LAN_6_C.H
        LAN_7_C.H

   These header files are installed during Extended Services
   installation.  To install the API header files select them
   from the "Install  Additional Features" panel.

   To compile and link make sure the current directory is the sample
   program subdirectory.  Rename the file DLCSAM16 as DLCSAM16.MAK.
   Type the following at the OS/2 command prompt:
           nmake dlcsam16.mak
   The file dlcsampo.exe will be created.


   C SAMPLE PROGRAM 32 BIT APPLICATION

   The C sample program and the following instructions are
   for the IBM C Set/2 Compiler.

   Set up the environment for the IBM C Set/2 Compiler according
   to the compiler documentation. Create a subdirectory for the
   sample program.  Make sure the include path accesses files
   in the toolkit.  The nmake utility used to compile and link
   the sample program is in the toolkit.  Be sure to include the
   path to nmake in the path statement when setting the work
   environment.

   Copy the following into the sample program subdirectory from
   the sample program diskette:

        DLCSAMPO.C    - sample program source code
        DIRINTF.H     - sample program header file
        DLCERROR.H    - sample program header file
        DLCGBLV.H     - sample program header file
        DLCINTF.H     - sample program header file
        DLCSAMPO      - 32 bit sample program make file
        DLCSAMPO.DEF  - sample program module definition file

   Copy the following Extended Services LAN Adapter and Protocol
   Support header files into the sample program subdirectory:

        LAN_1_C.H
        LAN_2_C.H
        LAN_3_C.H
        LAN_4_C.H
        LAN_6_C.H
        LAN_7_C.H

   These header files are installed during Extended Services
   installation.  To install the API header files select them
   from the "Install  Additional Features" panel.

   Add the following to the source program DLCSAMPO.C

        #define E32TO16

   This will cause the 32-bit versions of the .H files to be expanded
   when compiling.

   To compile and link make sure the current directory is the sample
   program subdirectory.  Rename the file DLCSAMPO as DLCSAMPO.MAK.
   Type the following at the OS/2 command prompt:
           nmake dlcsampo.mak
   The file dlcsampo.exe will be created.


   RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAM


   Set up one OS/2 session per machine.  Change the current
   directory to the directory containing DLCSAMPO.EXE.

   The sample program has a sender and receiver.  Start the
   receiver first.  At the command prompt enter:

       dlcsampo r a=adapter_num

   To start the sender, at the command prompt enter:

       dlcsampo s n=netaddress a=adapter_num

   The default for adapter_num is 0.  If you are running on adapter 0
   the a= parameter can be ignored.  The n=netaddress parameter is the
   netaddress of the receiving adapter, the partner.  To display the
   netaddress enter:

       dlcsampo d a=adapter_num
