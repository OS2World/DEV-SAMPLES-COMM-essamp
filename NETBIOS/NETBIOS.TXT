   NETBIOS SAMPLE PROGRAM


   The NETBIOS sample program is an example of an application
   program written to the dynamic link interface of NETBIOS.
   The function of the sample program is to communicate on a
   Local Area Network using NETBIOS protocol.  In the sample
   scenario communication is set up between two NETBIOS session
   partners on the Local Area Network; one session sends data
   while the other receives the data.  The session partners
   can be on one machine or separate machines.

   The sample program is designed to run only in protected
   mode of IBM Extended Services for OS/2.  The sample program
   source code and supporting files are provided for C.  The
   sample program can be compiled as a 16 bit application or
   a 32 bit application.  The 16 bit program is compiled with
   the Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 and runs on OS/2 SE Version
   1.30.1 or higher.  The 32 bit program is compiled with the
   the IBM C Set/2 Compiler and runs on OS/2 Standard Edition
   Version 2.0.


   PREREQUISITES

   To run the sample program, a user must obtain and be familiar
   with the following:

   1.  OS/2 installation and program execution

   2.  TOOLKIT installation

   3.  IBM Extended Services for OS/2 including Communications
       Manager Installation and Configuration

   5.  Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 (for 16-bit programs) or
       IBM C Set/2 Compiler (for 32-bit programs)


   HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

   One or two PS/2 or AT machines which are connected to the same
   Local Area Network.  The network adapter must be one supported by
   IBM Extended Services for OS/2.  The adapter should be configured
   as adapter 0 or adapter 1.


   INSTALLATION

   The installation for running NETBIOS sample programs consists of the
   following:

   1. Installing IBM Extended Services for OS/2 including
      Communications Manager.

   2. Creating the LAN Adapter and Protocol Support configuration file
      for the network adapter installed and IBM OS/2 NETBIOS protocol
      for the sample program

   3. Installing TOOLKIT

   4. Installing the compiler selected


   ASSUMPTIONS

   The INSTALLATION DETAIL section explains the installation procedure.
   It is assumed that Extended Services, TOOLKIT and the compiler
   are installed on the same drive. For ease of discussion the C drive
   is used as the default.

   INSTALLATION DETAIL

   1. INSTALLING IBM EXTENDED SERVICES FOR OS/2

   Install IBM Extended Services for OS/2 according to the
   installation documentation provided with the product.
   When you install make sure you install LAN Adapter
   and Protocol Support.

   To build the NETBIOS sample program, the Communications
   Manager API data structures must be installed on the build
   machine.  The API data structures are high level language
   include files.  To install the API data structures select them
   from the "Install Additional Features" panel.

   2. CREATING NETBIOS SAMPLE PROGRAM CONFIGURATION FILE

   Use Communications Manager Advanced Configuration and
   select LAN Adapter and Protocol Support to configure
   the workstation.  Configure the network adapter
   driver for the network adapter installed and configure
   the NETBIOS protocol driver for adapter 0 or 1.  The
   default configuration parameters for both the network
   adapter driver and the NETBIOS protocol driver are
   sufficient to run the sample program.


   4. INSTALLING TOOLKIT

   Install TOOLKIT using its installation procedure.


   5. INSTALLING THE COMPILER

   For the 16-bit application install Microsoft C Compiler
   Version 6.0 using the installation procedure for the compiler.
   For the 32-bit application install IBM C Set/2 Compiler
   using the installation procedure for the compiler.




   C SAMPLE PROGRAM 16 BIT APPLICATION

   The C sample program and the following instructions are
   for Microsoft C version 6.0.

   Set up the environment for the Microsoft C Compiler according
   to the compiler documentation. Create a subdirectory for the
   sample program.

   Copy the following into the sample program subdirectory from
   the sample program diskette:

        NETSAMPO.C    - sample program source code
        NETERROR.H    - sample program header file
        NETGBLV.H     - sample program header file
        NETSAM16      - 16 bit sample program make file
        NETSAMPO.DEF  - sample program module definition file

   Copy the following Extended Services LAN Adapter and Protocol
   Support header files into the sample program subdirectory:

        NETB_1_C.H
        NETB_2_C.H
        NETB_4_C.H
        LAN_7_C.H

   These header files are installed during Extended Services
   installation.  To install the API header files select them
   from the "Install  Additional Features" panel.

   To compile and link make sure the current directory is the sample
   program subdirectory.  Rename the file NETSAM16 as NETSAM16.MAK.
   Type the following at the OS/2 command prompt:
           nmake netsam16.mak
   The file netsampo.exe will be created.


   C SAMPLE PROGRAM 32 BIT APPLICATION

   The C sample program and the following instructions are
   for the IBM C Set/2 Compiler.

   Set up the environment for the IBM C Set/2 Compiler according
   to the compiler documentation. Create a subdirectory for the
   sample program.  The nmake utiltity used to compile and link
   the sample program is in the toolkit.  Be sure to include
   the path to nmake in the path statement when setting up the
   work environment.

   Copy the following into the sample program subdirectory from
   the sample program diskette:

        NETSAMPO.C    - sample program source code
        NETERROR.H    - sample program header file
        NETGBLV.H     - sample program header file
        NETSAMPO      - 32 bit sample program make file
        NETSAMPO.DEF  - sample program module definition file

   Copy the following Extended Services LAN Adapter and Protocol
   Support header files into the sample program subdirectory:

        NETB_1_C.H
        NETB_2_C.H
        NETB_4_C.H
        LAN_7_C.H

   These header files are installed during Extended Services
   installation.  To install the API header files select them
   from the "Install  Additional Features" panel.

   Add the following to the source program NETSAMPO.C

        #define E32TO16

   This will cause the 32-bit versions of the .H files to be expanded
   when compiling.

   To compile and link make sure the current directory is the sample
   program subdirectory.  Rename the file NETSAMPO as NETSAMPO.MAK.
   Type the following at the OS/2 command prompt:
           nmake netsampo.mak
   The file netsampo.exe will be created.


   RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAM


   If you are running the sample program on one machine set up two
   OS/2 sessions.  If you are running the sample program on two
   machines set up one OS/2 session per machine.  Change the
   current directory to the directory containing NETSAMPO.EXE.

   The sample program has a sender and receiver.  Start the
   receiver first.  At the command prompt enter:

       netsampo recv adapter=adapter_num lclname=rcvname netname=sendname

   In the OS/2 session (either on the same machine or the partner
   machine) at the command prompt enter:

       netsampo send adapter=adapter_num lclname=sendname netname=rcvname

   The parameter adapter= defaults to 0.  The sender's local name defaults
   to netsamplesend and the receiver's local name defaults to netsamplerecv.
   The netname for each is the partner's local name.

   To simply use the defaults the respective inputs for the receiver
   and sender are:

       netsampo recv

       netsampo send
