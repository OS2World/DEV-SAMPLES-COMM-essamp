IBM Extended Services for OS/2 Programmable Configuration Samples

These samples are to be used as a guide when you code your Programmable
Configuration REXX programs.  They are not intended to be copied and
executed as they are presented here.  Many fields require resource names
and addresses from your institution's environment.

*******************************************************************************

ACDI.CMD
   This is a sample Programmable Configuration program to configure ACDI
   over an asynchronous connection to a remote computer.  The features
   and records that must be configured to establish this connection are:
      MACHINE WKST
      ACDI STRING
      ACDI PORT
   It is assumed that the model connected to the workstation for this
   sample is one for which an IBM model exists as follows:
      M1 - for Hayes Smartmodem 1200, IBM PC 2400, ROLM 244PC
      M2 - for Hayes Smartmodem 2400
      M3 - for Hayes V-Series Modem Enhancer 1200
      M4 - for Hayes V-Series Modem Enhancer 2400
      M5 - for MicroCom AX/2400C
      M6 - for V.25vis Command Set Modems
      M7 - for IBM PC 1200

*******************************************************************************

TWINAX.CMD
   This is a sample Programmable Configuration program to configure APPN
   over a twinaxial connection.  The features and records that must be
   configured to establish this connection are:
      MACHINE WKST

      APPN DEFINE_DEFAULTS is automatically added
      APPN DEFINE_TP
      APPN START_ATTACH_MANAGER is automatically added
      APPN CNOS_FQ_PLU_NAME
      APPN DEFINE_USER_ID_PASSWORD
   There must be an application program installed on the workstation that
   interfaces with the APPN API.

      SNA XDLC
      APPN DEFINE_LOCAL_CP
      APPN DEFINE_LOGICAL_LINK
      APPN CNOS PLU Alias Profile
      APPN DEFINE_PARTNER_LU
      APPN DEFINE_PARTNER_LU_LOCATION
      APPN DEFINE_MODE
      APPN DEFINE_DEFAULTS
      X25 ADAPTER
      X25 PVC
      X25 LINK
      X25 RDIR
      X25 ROUTE
      5250 TERM
      5250 SESSION

*******************************************************************************

3270.CMD
   This is a sample Programmable Configuration program to configure 3270
   DFT connection via a 3278/79 or 3270 adapter.  The features and records
   that must be configured to establish this connection are:
      MACHINE WKST
      3270DFT CONNECT
      3270DFT SESSION

*******************************************************************************

5250.CMD
   This is a sample Programmable Configuration program to configure APPN
   connection using 5250 Workstation Emulation.  The features and records
   that must be configured to establish this connection are:
      MACHINE WSKT
      SNA TDLC
      APPN DEFINE_LOGICAL_LINK
      APPN DEFINE_LOCAL_CP
      APPN DEFINE_PARTNER_LU
      APPN DEFINE_PARTNER_LU_LOCATION
      APPN DEFINE_MODE
      APPN DEFINE_DEFAULTS is automatically added
      APPN CNOS_FQ_PLU_NAME
      5250 TERM
      5250 PRT
      5250 SESSION
   There must be an application program installed on the workstation that
   interfaces with the APPN API.
