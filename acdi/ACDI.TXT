   ACDI SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   The ACDI sample programs are examples of application programs written
   using the ACDI interface verbs. The function of the sample programs is
   to echo, line by line, a screen image from one personal computer to a
   second personal computer. To support the function, there are two
   sample programs:  one for the transmit side and one for the
   receive side. Characters typed on the transmit side are echoed on the
   receive side, one line at a time.

   The sample programs are designed to work in the OS/2 protect mode, with
   Extended Services Communications Manager.  Sample program source code
   and the supporting files are provided for C and Macro Assembler
   languages.

   RESTRICTIONS

   Only alphanumeric keys are supported. The backspace, cursor movement, and
   other keys are not supported by the sample programs.

   PREREQUISITE INFORMATION

   To run the sample programs, a user must be familiar with the following:

   1.  OS/2 installation and command prompt
   2.  Installation of the Toolkit
   3.  Extended Services Communications Manager installation
   4.  Compiler of the language in which you are interested.

   HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

   The two PS/2 or AT systems are to be connected to each other through a
   null modem on an RS232 cable to ports COM1 for a non-switched connection.
   If your connection or ports are different from this, then you must
   select the appropriate parameters on the Select Modem/Interface Device
   and Select Line Interface panels during Communications Manager
   configuration.

   INSTALLATION

   To build the ACDI sample programs, the following programs must
   be installed on the build machine:

   1. OS/2 Standard Edition Version 1.30.1 or
      OS/2 Standard Edition Version 2.0
   2. IBM Extended Services for OS/2 with Communications Manager
      and with the Communications Manager API data structures
   3. OS/2 Standard Edition Version 1.3 Programming Tools and Information
      (Toolkit)
   4. Microsoft C Version 6.0 or IBM Macro Assembler/2 Version 1.0

   INSTALLING IBM EXTENDED SERVICES FOR OS/2

   When installing Extended Services, make sure that you install
   the Communications Manager with ACDI.  You can explictly install
   ACDI by selecting it from the "Install Additional Features" panel.
   Or, if you install the ASCII Terminal Emulator, then ACDI will
   automatically be installed.

   To build the ACDI sample programs, the Communcations Manager API
   data structures must be installed on the build machine.  The API
   data structores are high level language include files.  To install
   the API data structures select them from the "Install Additonal
   Features" panel.

   CREATING ACDI SAMPLE PROGRAM CONFIGURATION FILES

   Create a configuration file for the ACDI sample program using the
   configuration functions in Communications Manager.

   The following instructions will configure two workstations on which
   the OS/2 program has been installed to run the ACDI sample programs.
   The instructions guide you through the configuration process, panel
   by panel, until complete.

   On the workstation that will run the receive side of the sample
   program, copy the system-supplied configuration file named ACSCFGUS.CFG
   to ACDISAMP.CFG in the C:\CMLIB directory.

   Start Communications Manager for the receive side using ACDISAMP
   as the startup configuration file.

   Beginning at the Communications Manager Main Menu, complete the
   following instructions.

   Press the Switch to Action Bar (F10) key.
   Select "Advanced" from the action bar.
   Select "Configuration" from the Advanced pull-down.
   Select Enter.

   Specify the configuration file name.
   Enter ACDISAMP in the Name field if not already there.
   Select Enter.

   Specify Configuration Usage.
   Select "Select this option if you intend to use this configuration
   on this workstation."

   The Communications Configuration Menu is displayed.
   Select "Asynchronous feature profiles" from the Communications
   Configuration Menu.

   Select "Asynchronous communication port profiles" from the Asynchronous
   Feature Configuration menu.

   Select "Create" from the Profile Operations panel.

   The Select Asynchronous Communications Port Profile panel is displayed.
   Select "COM1" from the Select Asynchronous Communication Port panel.
   Select Enter.

   The Specify Telephone Network ID panel is displayed.
   Specify the telephone network ID "011"
   Select Enter.

   The Select Interface Device panel is displayed.
   Specify "Device" to be "Other modem or device" (be sure to use
   the Spacebar).
   Select Enter.

   The Select Line Interface panel is displayed.
   Select "Non-switched" from the Select Line Interface panel.
   Select Enter.

   Select Esc=Cancel on the Asynchronous Feature Configuration panel.

   Press the F10 key on the Communication Configuration Menu panel.
   Select "Verify" from the action bar.
   Select "Run verify" from the Verify pull-down.

   When the verification is successfully completed press Enter to
   remove the panel.

   Press the F10 key.
   Select "Exit" from the action bar.
   Select "Exit communication configuration" from the Exit pull-down.

   Exit Communications Manager.

   The receive and transmit configuration files are the same.  If both
   workstations are running under IBM Extended Services and the port
   configurations are identical, you can copy ACDISAMP.CFG to the other
   workstation instead of going through the configuration steps again.


   INSTALLING THE COMPILER

   Install the compiler for the language in which you are interested.
   Use the installation procedure for the compiler.   Refer to the
   following section on supported languages for additional information.

   Note:  The instructions that you are to type at the OS/2 command prompt
          show the command line with the path for information only.  For
          example, [C:] is displayed, but you should not type
          it at the OS/2 command prompt.  Also, you should not type the
          instruction [press Enter].

   SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

   1.  C LANGUAGE SETUP

       a.  INSTALLING THE C COMPILER

           Install the Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 using the
           installation procedure for the compiler. The SETUP program is
           used to install the compiler.  Insert the Setup diskette
           in drive A, make drive A the current drive and type the
           following at the OS/2 command prompt:

             [A:\]setup  [press Enter]

           Follow the directions provided by the menus.  Select the
           default directories and subdirectories, and be certain the
           large model compiler is selected. The compiler is installed
           at this point.

       b.  SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

           During the compiler installation, a file called NEW-VARS.CMD
           is placed in the C:\C600\BIN directory.  This file contains
           commands to setup environment variables used by the Mirosoft
           C compiler.  These commands can be copied to the CONFIG.SYS
           file and the computer rebooted or you can just simply use
           NEW-VARS.CMD file directly.  In any case, the path to the
           C:\CMLIB directory needs to be added to the INCLUDE and LIB
           environment variables.  This allows the compiler to find the
           ACDI_C.H and the ACS.LIB files that are in the C:\CMLIB
           directory.  Likewise, the path to the toolkit include directory
           should be included on the INCLUDE environment variable.  The
           path to the toolkit library directory should be included on
           the LIB environment variable.  The INCLUDE and LIB enviroment
           commands should look something like this:

           SET INCLUDE=C:\C600\INCLUDE;C:\TOOLKT13\C\INCLUDE;C:\CMLIB;
           SET LIB=C:\C600\LIB;C:\OS2;C:\TOOLKT13\LIB:C:\CMLIB;

           You should also make sure that the PATH environment variable
           includes the paths to the C compiler and toolkit binary files.
           The PATH should have as a minimum:

           SET PATH=C:\C600\BINB;C:\C600\BINP;C:\CMLIB;C:\TOOLKT13\BIN;

           The PATH command will most likely contain many additional paths.

       c.  BUILDING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

           Create a directory on the build machine called SAMPBLD.  Copy
           all the files from the A:\ACDI\ACDI_C directory to the SAMPBLD
           directory.  To build the receive sample program type at an OS/2
           command prompt:

           [C:\SAMPBLD\]nmake acdicrcv [press Enter]

           This will cause the ACDICRCV.C program to the compiled, linked
           and messages bound.  The final result is ACDICRCV.EXE.

           To build the transmit sample program type at an OS/2 command
           prompt:

           [C:\SAMPBLD\]nmake acdicxmt [press Enter]

           This builds the transmit sample program: ACDICXMT.EXE

   2.  MACRO ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE SETUP

       a.  INSTALLING MACRO ASSEMBLER

           Install the IBM Macro Assembler/2 Version 1.0 using the
           installation procedure for the assembler. The INSTAID program
           is used to install the assembler.  Insert the master diskette
           in drive A, and type the following at the OS/2 command prompt:

             [C:\]instaid [press Enter]

           Follow the directions provided by the menus. Select the
           default directories and subdirectories.  The assembler is
           installed at this point.

           During installation of the assembler, the \MASM\BIN
           directory is created.

       b.  SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

           The CONFIG.SYS file contains commands which initialize the
           PATH, INCLUDE and LIB environment variables.  The path to
           the C:\CMLIB directory needs to be added to the INCLUDE and
           LIB environment variables.  This allows the compiler to
           find the ACDI_A.INC and the ACS.LIB files that are in the
           C:\CMLIB directory.  Likewise, the path to the toolkit
           include directory should be included on the INCLUDE
           environment variable.  The path to the toolkit library
           directory should be included on the LIB environment
           variable.  The INCLUDE and LIB enviroment commands should
           look something like this:

           SET INCLUDE=C:\TOOLKT13\MASM\INCLUDE;C:\CMLIB;
           SET LIB=C:\TOOLKT13\LIB:C:\CMLIB;

           You should also make sure that the PATH environment
           variable includes the paths to the assembler and toolkit
           binary files.  The PATH should have as a minimum:

           SET PATH=C:\MASM\BIN;C:\CMLIB;C:\TOOLKT13\BIN;

           The PATH command will most likely contain many additional paths.

       c.  ASSEMBLING AND LINKING THE MACRO ASSEMBLER SAMPLE PROGRAMS

           Create a directory on the build machine called SAMPBLD.
           Copy all the files from the A:\ACDI\ACDI_M directory to the
           SAMPBLD directory.  To build the receive sample program type
           at an OS/2 command prompt:

           [C:\SAMPBLD\]make acdimrcv [press Enter]

           This will cause the ACDIMRCV.C program to the assembled,
           linked and messages bound.  The final result is
           ACDIMRCV.EXE.

           To build the transmit sample program type at an OS/2 command
           prompt:

           [C:\SAMPBLD\]make acdimxmt [press Enter]

           This builds the transmit sample program: ACDIMXMT.EXE

   RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   Create a new directory named SAMPLE on the transmit side workstation.
   Copy the transmit sample program (ACDICXMT.EXE or ACDIMXMT.EXE) to the
   SAMPLE directory.

   Create a new directory named SAMPLE on the receive side workstation.
   Copy the receive sample program (ACDICRCV.EXE or ACDIMRCV.EXE) to the
   SAMPLE directory.

   Start Communications Manager on both workstations, the transmit side and
   the receive side, with the configuration file ACDISAMP.   ACDI has
   already been loaded on both workstations (ACDI is the default).

   Select "OS/2 command prompt" from the Program Selector panel on
   each workstation.  Change the current directory to SAMPLE.  If
   there is a blue help line at the top of the screen, type "help off"
   to remove help.  Start your receive program (ACDICRCV.EXE or
   ACDIMRCV.EXE) on the receive workstation.  Then start your transmit
   program (ACDICXMT.EXE or ACDIMXMT.EXE) on the other workstation.

   You will see a blank screen displayed.  Start typing at the transmit
   side.  The information you type is echoed at the receive side, line by
   line.  To end the connection, press the Interrupt (Ctrl+C) key.

   NOTE: If the High Speed DMA Asynchronous Device Driver is installed
         on the receive workstation, the receive sample program (ACDICRCV.EXE
         or ACDIMRCV.EXE) will terminate with an apparent error.  This
         behavior is inherent to the design of the High Speed DMA Asynchronous
         Device Driver and does not indicate an error with the workstation or
         the sample program, and the state of the workstation after termination
         is identical to the termination state of a workstation not using the
         High Speed Asynchronous Device Driver.
