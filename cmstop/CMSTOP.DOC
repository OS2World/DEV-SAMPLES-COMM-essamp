   CMSTOP SAMPLE PROGRAM

   The CMSTOP sample program is an example of an application program written
   using the CmkDeactivateService verb. The function of the sample program is
   to request the Communications Manager to start its exit processing.

   The sample program is designed to work in the OS/2 protect mode,
   with Extended Services 1.0 Communications Manager. Sample program
   source code and the supporting files are provided for C.

   RESTRICTIONS

   CMSTOP uses the Communications Manager API CmkDeactivateService.  This
   API simulates a user selecting Exit from the Advanced Pull Down on the
   Main Menu.  For this API to work the Communications Manager must be
   displaying the Main Menu,  otherwise it will take effect when the
   Main Menu is re-displayed.

   PREREQUISITE INFORMATION

   To run the sample programs, a user must be familiar with the following:

   1.  OS/2 installation and command prompt
   2.  Installation of the Toolkit
   3.  Extended Services Communications Manager installation
   4.  Compiler of the language in which you are interested.

   INSTALLATION

   To build the CMSTOP sample program, the following programs must
   be installed on the build machine:

   1. OS/2 Standard Edition Version 1.30.1 or
      OS/2 Standard Edition Version 2.0
   2. IBM Extended Services Version 1.0 with Communications Manager
      and with the Communications Manager API data structures
   3. OS/2 Standard Edition Version 1.3 Programming Tools and Information
      (Toolkit)
   4. Microsoft C Version 6.0 or equivalent compiler.

   INSTALLING IBM EXTENDED SERVICES VERSION 1.0

   Install OS/2 and the Communications Manager according to instructions
   in the documentation provided with the product.

   CREATING CMSTOP SAMPLE PROGRAM CONFIGURATION FILES

   No special configuration is required.

   INSTALLING THE COMPILER

   Install the compiler for the language in which you are interested.
   Use the installation procedure for the compiler.   Refer to the
   following section on supported languages for additional information.

   Note:  The instructions that you are to type at the OS/2 command prompt
          show the command line with the path for information only.  For
          example, [C:] is displayed, but you should not type
          it at the OS/2 command prompt.  Also, you should not type the
          instruction [press Enter].

   SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

   1.  C LANGUAGE SETUP

       a.  INSTALLING THE C COMPILER

           Install the Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 using the
           installation procedure for the compiler. The SETUP program is
           used to install the compiler.  Insert the Setup diskette
           in drive A, make drive A the current drive and type the
           following at the OS/2 command prompt:

             [A:\]setup  [press Enter]

           Follow the directions provided by the menus.  Select the
           default directories and subdirectories, and be certain the
           large model compiler is selected. The compiler is installed
           at this point.

       b.  SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

           During the compiler installation, a file called NEW-VARS.CMD
           is placed in the C:\C600\BIN directory.  This file contains
           commands to setup environment variables used by the Microsoft
           C compiler.  These commands can be copied to the CONFIG.SYS
           file and the computer rebooted or you can just simply use
           NEW-VARS.CMD file directly.  In any case, the path to the
           C:\CMLIB directory needs to be added to the INCLUDE and LIB
           environment variables.  This allows the compiler to find the
           ACDI_C.H and the ACS.LIB files that are in the C:\CMLIB
           directory.  Likewise, the path to the toolkit include directory
           should be included on the INCLUDE environment variable.  The
           path to the toolkit library directory should be included on
           the LIB environment variable.  The INCLUDE and LIB environment
           commands should look something like this:

           SET INCLUDE=C:\C600\INCLUDE;C:\TOOLKT13\C\INCLUDE;C:\CMLIB;
           SET LIB=C:\C600\LIB;C:\OS2;C:\TOOLKT13\LIB:C:\CMLIB;

           You should also make sure that the PATH environment variable
           includes the paths to the C compiler and toolkit binary files.
           The PATH should have as a minimum:

           SET PATH=C:\C600\BINB;C:\C600\BINP;C:\CMLIB;C:\TOOLKT13\BIN;

           The PATH command will most likely contain many additional paths.

       c.  BUILDING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

           Create a directory on the build machine called SAMPBLD.  Copy
           all the files from the A:\CMSTOP directory to the SAMPBLD
           directory.  To build the sample program type at an OS/2
           command prompt:

           [C:\SAMPBLD\]nmake cmstop [press Enter]

           This will cause the CMSTOP.C program to the compiled, linked
           and messages bound.  The final result is CMSTOP.EXE.

   RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   Start Communications Manager on your workstation.  From an OS/2
   full screen or windowed command prompt enter CMSTOP <stop_type>.

   The <stop_type> is optional and corresponds to the selections
   on the Exit Pulldown on the Main Menu.  They options are "SOFT"
   and "HARD".  Soft refers to the "Exit when complete" choice,
   while hard refers to "Exit Immediate".  If no stop type is entered
   or the type is not recognized, then soft is defaulted.  If the
   stop_type begins with an 'H' then an Immediate Stop is sent.

   A successful return means that the stop has been accepted,  not that
   the stop has occurred.  This is necessary so that a user can enter
   a hard stop if the soft stop does not complete.  An unsuccessful
   return will display an error to the screen.
