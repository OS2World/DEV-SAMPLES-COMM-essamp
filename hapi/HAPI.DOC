        EHLLAPI SAMPLE PROGRAMS

        The EHLLAPI sample programs are a sample of writing application
        programs using the EHLLAPI functions.  The sample programs are
        designed to work in the OS/2 protect mode, with the Communications
        Manager of the IBM Extended Services for OS/2.  Sample program
        source code and the supporting files are provided for C, MASM,
        COBOL, and BASIC Compiler languages.  Since the sample programs are
        in source form, you will need to go through additional steps to run
        these programs.

        The sample programs request EHLLAPI configuration information and
        HOST session information.  The sample programs then attempt to send
        the string "EHLLAPI" to one of the started sessions.  An EHLLAPI
        search function will be called to search for the string.  Last, the
        first 1920 characters of the host session screen will be displayed.

        Also provided on the sample program diskette is the Program Sampler
        executable file.  This Program Sampler (HLLSAMP.EXE) lets you
        experiment with various EHLLAPI functions.  See "Running the
        Program Sampler" in the EHLLAPI Programming Guide.

        RESTRICTIONS

        1.  The Communications Manager must be loaded with at least one
            3270 or one 5250 session started.  The 5250 session must not be
            a printer session.

        PREREQUISITES

        To run a sample program, you must be familiar with the following
        things:

        1.  OS/2 installation and command prompt

        2.  Communications Manager installation

        3.  Compiler for the desired language

        INSTALLATION

        Install OS/2 and Communications Manager according to instructions
        in "IBM Extended Services for OS/2 Start Here".

        The compiler associated with the desired language also needs to be
        installed using the installation procedure of that language
        compiler.  Refer to the following language sections for additional
        information.



                                                                               Page  1

        1.  DFT 3270 terminal emulation

        2.  SDLC 3270 terminal emulation

        3.  IBM Token-Ring Network 3270 terminal emulation

        4.  X.25 3270 terminal emulation

        5.  IBM PC Network via Gateway 3270 terminal emulation

        6.  5250 Work Station Feature


        For configuring and starting Communications Manager with the
        terminal emulation connections above, refer to the "IBM Extended
        Services for OS/2  User's Guide" and "IBM Extended Services for
        OS/2 System Administrator's Guide for Communications".

        RUNNING EHLLAPI SAMPLE PROGRAMS

        Create a new directory SAMPLE on the PC where your EHLLAPI sample
        program will reside.  Copy the executable (.EXE) created in the
        above compile and link process to the SAMPLE subdirectory.

        From the "Communications Manager Main Menu", start the 3270
        emulation feature.  Switch to an OS/2 screen group and change the
        current directory to SAMPLE.  Execute the sample EHLLAPI program.
        The sample program will prompt you to press ENTER at certain points
        within the program execution.

        The functions which demonstrate the Structured Field process
        requires the host file transfer file, IND$FILE, to be present on


                                                                               Page  4        



        the host session.  The sample program will prompt the user to
        verify this and allow him to continue by selecting "Y" or to stop
        execution by selecting "N".
