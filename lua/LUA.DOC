   LUA SAMPLE PROGRAM


   The LUA sample programs provide examples for writing application
   programs using the LUA interface verbs. The function of the sample
   programs is to communicate with a HOST using the LUA interface
   verbs to SEND and RECEIVE data, SNA commands, and responses. The
   sample scenario consists of an OS/2 program (secondary),
   communicating with a HOST program (primary).

   NOTE: There is information included in the source module
         header of VTAMPGMA.JCL, the HOST (primary) sample
         program. You need to configure the  APPL  table
         and  MODE  table entries before execution.


   After compiling and linking, a user starts the secondary program,
   supplying a filename and path at the OS/2 command prompt.
   The primary sample program is started by submitting the
   assemble, link, and go job to MVS.

   The secondary sample programs are designed to run only in
   protected mode of IBM Extended Services for OS/2.
   There are 3 equivalent secondary sample programs, where the
   program source code and the supporting files are for C,
   MASM, and COBOL languages. The primary sample
   program source code language is 370 ASSEMBLER.


   PREREQUISITES

   To run the sample programs, a user must obtain and be familiar
   with the following:

   1.  OS/2 installation and program execution

   2.  TOOLKIT installation

   3.  Communications Manager installation

   4.  Compiler of the language(s) selected

   5.  Host VTAM and NCP configuration





                                                                         1

   SUPPORTED LANGUAGES

   1.  C LANGUAGE

       a.  C SAMPLE PROGRAM

           The C sample program and the following instructions
           are for Microsoft C version 6.0.

           There is one 'C' language LUA sample program for the
           secondary which is called LUASAMPC. Copy this file
           into directory C:\C600. The files to be copied are
           Source code (.C extension), Module definition
           (.DEF extension), Make file (no extension), and Link
           response (.LRF extension).

           All the INCLUDE files are required in \C600\INCLUDE
           directory. Copy the files LUA_C.H and ACSSVCC.H from the
           Communications Manager directory (C:\CMLIB) into the
           \C600\INCLUDE directory. Also copy DOSCALLS.H from
           C:\TOOLKTxx\C\INCLUDE directory into \C600\INCLUDE
           directory.

       b.  LIBRARY FILES FOR C SAMPLE PROGRAM

           For this example, all the LIBRARY files must reside
           in \C600\LIB directory.  Copy ACS.LIB from the
           Communications Manager directory (CMLIB) into
           the \C600\LIB directory and DOSCALLS.LIB from the
           OS/2 directory (OS2) into the \C600\LIB directory.






















                                                                        6




       c.  COMPILE/LINK C SAMPLE PROGRAM

           You must set up the environment for the Microsoft C compiler
           in order to use it; refer to the installation documentation
           provided with the product for instructions.

           Language extensions must be enabled in order for the C
           compiler to recognize the "pascal" and "far" keywords.
           Therefore, note that the compiler option /Za should NOT
           appear either on the compiler command line input (e.g., in
           the MAKE file) or in the environment setup file (e.g., in the
           NEW-VARS.CMD file).  After setting up the environment variables
           proceed as follows:

           Change your current directory to C:\C600

           To compile and link the secondary program, type the following
           at the OS/2 command prompt:

             [C:\C600]nmake luasampc /r [Press Enter]


           The file LUASAMPC.EXE will be created.


           After the above procedure, the executable file LUASAMPC.EXE
           is in directory C:\C600 in executable form.

























                                                                        7

           higher.

           There is one 'COBOL' language LUA sample program for the
           secondary which is called LUASAMPO. Copy this file from
           the LUA_CBL subdirectory on the sample program diskette
           into directory C:\COBOL. The files to be copied are Source
           code (.CBL extension), Module definition (.DEF extension)
           and Link response (.LRF extension).
           Also copy the command file (LUASAMPO.CMD) from
           the LUA_CBL directory into directory C:\COBOL.

           Copy the include files LUA_C_C.CBL, LUA_C.CBL, LUA_C_O.CBL,

   RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS



   Create a new directory SAMPLE on the secondary side workstation.
   Copy the secondary sample program (LUASAMPC.EXE, LUASAMPM.EXE,
   or LUASAMPO.EXE) to the SAMPLE directory.


   On the primary side, submit the assemble, link, and go, using
   VTAMPGMA.JCL, uploaded to the HOST with the BINARY option.
   Before submitting the VTAMPGMA program, the question marks in
   the USER and PASSWORD fields on the JOB statement should be
   replaced by your logon ID and password.


   It is recommended that the primary sample program be started
   prior to the secondary, in that the primary may take several
   minutes to complete the assemble, link, and go steps.


   Start Communication Manager on the secondary using the
   configuration file ACSLUA.


   Then switch to OS/2 Task Manager and select the OS/2 full screen
   command prompt. Change the current directory to SAMPLE.  Start
   your secondary program (LUASAMPC.EXE, LUASAMPM.EXE, or
   LUASAMPO.EXE) with the filename of the SAMPLE program you
   want to run.
























                                                                        12
