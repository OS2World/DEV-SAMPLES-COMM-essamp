 REACTX25 SAMPLE APPLICATION

 The REACTX25 sample program reactivates the X.25 adapter
 when an adapter failure occurs.  Many adapter failures can
 be recovered after the adapter is shut down.  This program
 issues the SET_USER_LOG_QUEUE verb to wait for an error of
 type 0017.  If this is a subtype 2 then either a link
 failure or an adapter failure occured.  This module assumes
 an adapter failed.  The DISCONNECT_PHYSICAL_LINK and
 CONNECT_PHYSICAL_LINK verbs are then issued until the
 CONNECT_PHYSICAL_LINK verb returns with a non zero return
 code.  The Communications Manager periodically reactivates
 the DLC so that when this X.25 is reconnected the DLC
 should be automatically reactivated.  It is still up to the
 application to reactivate the link either explicitly or by
 attempting to use it again.

 The sample programs are designed to work in the OS/2 pro-
 tected mode, with the Communications Manager of the OS/2
 Extended Services.  The sample program source code and the
 supporting files are for C only.

 PREREQUISITES

 To run the sample program, a user must be familiar with the
 following things:

 1.  OS/2 installation and command prompt

 2.  Communications Manager installation

 3.  C language compiler







 COMPILE and LINK

 There is only one sample program for reactivating the X.25
 adapter.  Copy all the files with the filename of REACTX25
 into the C source code subdirectory.  The files to be
 copied are the Source code (.C extension), Module
 definition (.DEF extension), Make file (no extension), and
 the Link response (.LRF extension).

 This sample program will need to access ACSMGTC.H and
 ACSSVC.H.  These include files should be in the \CMLIB
 subdirectory.

 Set up the environment for the C compiler according to the
 compilers instructions.


 To compile and link the sample program, type the following
 at the OS/2 command prompt:


 [C:\SRC]make reactx25 [Press Enter]

 After the above procedure, the executable file REACTX25.EXE
 will be created.


 RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAM

 The sample program can be either executed at the command
 line or in the STARTUP.CMD file.  There are no parameters.
 The sample program will display messages to the screen
 indicating the status of the program.  If REACTX25.EXE is
 started before the Communications Manager then it will wait
 for Communications Manager to start.
