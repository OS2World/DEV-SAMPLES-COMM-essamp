SET AND EXTRACT CPI-C SIDE INFORMATION REXX SAMPLE PROGRAMS

The function of the XCMSSI.CMD and XCMESI.CMD sample programs
is to demonstrate how to set and extract CPI-C side information
using the REXX environment for CPI-C, CPICOMM.   (Executing
the supplied program CPICREXX.EXE registers the CPICOMM environment
with REXX.)

XCMSSI.CMD is an example of how to set side information variables
then access the CPICOMM environment to set side information.
You can change the values used to set side information
to values that suit your configuration needs.

XCMESI.CMD is an example of how to extract existing side information.
XCMESI.CMD first extracts all existing side information using the entry
number as the key.  Then it extracts a particular side information
entry by using the symbolic destination name as the key.

The sample programs are designed to work with Communications Manager
while in the protected mode of OS/2 Extended Edition or Extended
Services program.  The source code for the sample programs is for
the REXX language.

PREREQUISITES

o Communications Manager must be configured as either an End Node or
  a Network Node and have at least a CP defined.  Communications Manager
  must be active.

RUNNING THE SAMPLE PROGRAMS

1.  From the requester side, switch to OS/2 and select the OS/2 Full Screen
    or OS/2 Window command prompt.

2.  If you haven't yet run the CPICREXX.EXE program since you last started
    your system, type:
          CD \CMLIB\APPN
          CPICREXX

    Note: CPICREXX.EXE must be executed at some point prior to running
          any REXX program which uses the CPICOMM environment.

3.  To run the set CPI-C side information sample program type:
          CD path\SNA\CPICREXX
          START /F XCMSSI

    The /F parameter makes the sample program the foreground session.

4.  Read the message displayed by XCMSSI.CMD, then press any key
    to terminate XCMSSI.CMD and the window.

5.  To run the extract CPI-C side information sample program type:
          START /FS XCMESI

    The /FS parameter gives the sample program a full screen to display
    its messages.

6.  Read the messages displayed by XCMESI, then press any key
    to terminate XCMESI.CMD and the full screen.

    Note: Each sample program is coded to exit from the "started" window
          or full screen when it completes.  The same effect can be achieved
          by adding the /C parameter to the START command.

    Refer to Common Programming Interface Communications Reference
    (SC26-4399-03) for any CPI-C or REXX error return code values
    displayed by the sample programs.   Refer to the "Variables and
    Characteristics" appendix to translate CPI-C return code values to
    labels, then to the "Returns Codes" appendix for return code label
    descriptions, and to the REXX part of the "CPI Communications on OS/2"
    appendix for information on REXX error return codes.
    In addition to displayed return codes, messages may be
    logged in the Communications Manager message log,
    and for CPI-C error return code CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR (20),
    in particular, display the Communications Manager error log.
    Communications Manager Problem Determination Guide contains
    information on how to display the message log and error log,
    and descriptions of CPI-C message log and error log entries.

ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES FOR SETTING CPI-C SIDE INFORMATION

CPI-C side information may also be set when the Communications
Manager is loaded when you use the DEFINE_CPIC_SIDE_INFO verb
in a working node definition file (.NDF) in \CMLIB\APPN.

In addition the 'CPI Communications Side Info' option can be used;
this function can be invoked by running APPNV, by selecting the
Communications Manager Tools from Desktop Manager, or by using the
Communications Manager Menu. Any changes must be verified (by running APPNV,
for example).

The new CPI-C side information will be set the next time you start
the Communications Manager specifying this configuration file.
