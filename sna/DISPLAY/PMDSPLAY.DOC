PMDSPLAY SAMPLE PROGRAM

   The PMDSPLAY sample program displays, in an OS/2 Presentation Manager
   environment, status and configuration information for the active
   SNA configuration of the Communications Manager. PMDSPLAY demonstrates
   the use of the APPC management verbs DISPLAY and DISPLAY_APPN for
   retrieving this information.

   Source for the PMDSPLAY sample program is provided in C.  Most of
   the source is shared with the DISPLAY sample program.


RUNNING THE PMDSPLAY SAMPLE PROGRAM

   To run the sample programs, you need to have Communications Manager
   installed and running.

   In addition to providing PMDSPLAY as a sample program, Communications
   Manager will install the PMDSPLAY-related executable files in the
   directory \CMLIB\APPN. PMDSPLAY will be called from the Communications
   Manager Subsystem Management menu when 'Display active SNA configuration'
   is selected. Also, PMDSPLAY is called when 'SNA Network Definitions
   Configuration' is selected from the Desktop Manager.

   To use the remote capability of the PMDSPLAY sample program, the
   RDSPSRVR sample program must be installed on the remote computer.
   See the file RDSPSRVR.DOC.

   From an OS/2 command prompt (full-screen or windowed), enter the
   command as follows:

      START PMDSPLAY

   Options may be specified by selecting the Presentation Manager
   Action Bar Items and Menu Items.  Press F1 to get help.

   To display information about the local computer, do the following:

      o Select the "Display" Action Bar Item

      o Select the "General SNA" or "APPN" Menu Item

      o Select one of the Menu Items displayed

   To display the information on the screen only, do the following:

      o Select the "Options" Action Bar Item

      o Select the "Display to Screen" Menu Item

      Note:  This is the default, and is mutually exclusive with
             the "Display to File" Menu Item

   To display the information to the file of your choice, and have
   that information echoed to the screen, do the following:

      o Select the "Options" Action Bar Item

      o Select the "Display to File..." Menu Item

      o Select the file you wish to save the information in, using
        the listboxes and/or the entryfield as appropriate

      o If you wish to append to an existing file, select the "Append"
        checkbox

      o When you are done, select the "OK" pushbutton to select that
        file, or select the "Cancel" pushbutton to exit the dialog
        without saving any changes

   To display information about a partner LU, do the following:

      o Select the "Options" Action Bar Item

      o Select the "Select Target..." Menu Item

      o Select the partner whose information you wish to view, using
        the listbox and/or the entryfield as appropriate.  The partner
        LU name may be an alias, or a fully qualified partner LU name.
        The default choice, "Local", is the local computer.  Note that
        you can perform a "remote" display on your own computer by
        specifying your own LU alias or fully qualified LU name

      o When you are done, select the "OK" pushbutton to select that
        partner, or select the "Cancel" pushbutton to exit the dialog
        without saving any changes.  If you select "OK", PMDSPLAY will
        attempt to start a conversation with the specified partner.
        If it is unable to do so, the return codes and sense data will
        be shown.  If it is able to allocate the conversation, you
        may then choose the information you wish to see.  Only one
        conversation at a time is maintained, and if you choose
        "Local", any current conversation is terminated

   Context sensitive help is available by placing the cursor on any
   selectable field, and pressing Function Key 1 (F1).


COMPILING THE PMDSPLAY SAMPLE PROGRAM

   To compile the PMDSPLAY sample program, you must have the following
   installed:

   o Extended Services for OS/2 Release 1.0, Communications Manager and
     High Level Languages (HLL) include files.

   o The IBM Extended Services for OS/2 Communications Manager API
     Sample Programs Support diskette containing the program source.

   o Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 (including multi-thread support)

   The procedure is as follows.

   1.  Change directory to the directory containing the source for the
       PMDSPLAY sample program (path\SNA\DISPLAY).

   2.  In addition to the settings required for the C compiler and the
       IBM OS/2 Programming Tools, set the following environment
       variables to include the following directories:

          INCLUDE and LIB must include "\CMLIB".

   3.  Compile the program using the "nmake" command for Microsoft C compiler
       Version 6.0:
             nmake pmdsplay.mak
