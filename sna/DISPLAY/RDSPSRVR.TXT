   Communications Manager
   (c) Copyright International Business Machines Corp. 1991

APPCMGMT is designed to work in the OS/2 protect mode with Extended Services
Communications Manager. APPCMGMT is written using the C programming language.

RDSPSRVR SAMPLE PROGRAM

   The RDSPSRVR (remote DISPLAY server) sample program allows either
   the DISPLAY or PMDSPLAY sample program running on a remote computer
   to retrieve state and configuration information of the active SNA
   configuration of the Communications Manager on the computer on which
   RDSPSRVR is installed.

   Source for the RDSPSRVR sample program is provided in C.


RUNNING THE RDSPSRVR SAMPLE PROGRAM

   To run the sample programs, you need to have Communications Manager
   installed and running.

   In addition to RDSPSRVR being available as a sample program, Communications
   Manager will install RDSPSRVR.EXE in the directory \CMLIB\DSPSVR.
   This makes the program available without requiring the purchase
   of the separate Samples diskette.

   NOTE: This program gives remote users the ability to learn significant
         information about your machine including LU definitions, TP
         definitions, partner LU definitions, etc.. Be aware that these
         sample programs as written have no security capability; for this
         reason RDSPSRVR was not installed 'active' but requires you to
         take an explicate action, below, to enable RDSPSRVR to be called.

   To allow RDSPSRVR to run when a remote computer requests it, do one
   of the following:

   1.  Copy RDSPSRVR.EXE to the directory specified by the
       DIRECTORY_FOR_INBOUND_ATTACHES statement in your .NDF file.

   2.  Add a DEFINE_TP statement for RDSPSRVR to your .NDF file.
       An example DEFINE_TP statement appears below:

          DEFINE_TP TP_NAME(RDSPSRVR)
                    FILESPEC(C:\CMLIB\DSPSVR\RDSPSRVR.EXE)
                    CONV_SECURITY_RQD(NO)
                    CONVERSATION_TYPE(MAPPED)
                    PROGRAM_TYPE(BACKGROUND)
                    RECEIVE_ALLOCATE_TIMEOUT(100)
                    SYNC_LEVEL(EITHER)
                    TP_OPERATION(NONQUEUED_AM_STARTED)
                    DESCRIPTION(Server TP supporting remote display);

       After adding the DEFINE_TP statement to your .NDF file, you can
       make it take effect by using the /E option of the APPNV program;
       from the OS/2 command prompt, enter "APPNV fn /E", where "fn" is
       the filename of your .NDF file.


COMPILING THE RDSPSRVR SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   To compile the RDSPSRVR sample program, you must have the following
   installed:

   o Extended Services for OS/2 Release 1.0, Communications Manager and
     High Level Languages (HLL) include files.

   o The IBM Extended Services for OS/2 Communications Manager API
     Sample Programs Support diskette containing the program source.

   o Microsoft C Compiler Version 6.0 (including multi-thread support)

   The procedure is as follows.

   1.  Change directory to the directory containing the source for the
       RDSPSRVR sample program (path\SNA\DISPLAY).

   2.  In addition to the settings required for the C compiler and the
       IBM OS/2 Programming Tools, set the following environment
       variables to include the following directories:

          INCLUDE and LIB must include "\CMLIB".

   3.  Compile the program using the "nmake" command for Microsoft C compiler
       Version 6.0:

             nmake /f rdspsrvr.mak

       The source files associated with the RDSPSRVR sample program are
       listed below.

          RDSPSRVR.MAK - MAKE file
          RDSPSRVR.DEF - Module definition file (for LINK)
          DISPLAY.H    - Global typedefs, prototypes, and #includes
          RDSPSRVR.C   - Main function and unique utility functions
          APPCUTIL.C   - Common utility functions for remote DISPLAY
          EXECDISP.C   - Utility function to execute DISPLAY verb
          APD.TXT      - Messages (English)
          MSGID.H      - #defines for messages
