   SRPI SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   The SRPI sample programs are provided as an example of how the SRPI
   Send_Request interface verb can be used by a PC requester application
   to invoke a server on the host.  The function of the sample programs
   is to request records from a customer records data set on the IBM host
   computer.  The IBM host computer sends the customer records to the
   requester program for processing.  If the customer's balance in the
   record is positive, the record is sent back to the server.  The server
   puts the positive balance into an accounts receivable data set on the
   IBM host computer.  To support this function, a sample PC requester
   program, a sample host server program and a sample host data file are
   provided.

   The sample programs are designed to work in the OS/2 protect mode, with
   the Communications Manager of the Extended Services 1.0.  Sample program
   source code and the supporting files are provided for the C, MASM, and
   COBOL languages.  Since the sample programs are in source form, you will
   need to go through additional steps to run these programs.

   RESTRICTIONS

   1.  The Communications Manager must be loaded with at least one
       3270 terminal session configured for use with SRPI.

   2.  The sample server is based on the sample server source program
       documented in the "Programmer's Guide to the Server-Requester
       Programming Interface for VM/System Product".  The sample server
       provided is used to run under VM/CMS environment only.  For a
       sample server that will run under MVS environment, refer to the
       "TSO Extensions Programmer's Guide to the Server-Requester
       Programming Interface for MVS/Extended Architecture" for more
       information.

   3.  The balance field in the customer record is in binary format and
       it is non-displayable on VM in the sample customer data set.

   PREREQUISTES

   To run a sample program, you must be familiar with the following
   things:

   1.  OS/2 installation and command prompt

   2.  Communications Manager installation

   3.  Compiler for the desired language

   4.  VM/CMS operation and commands




                                                                        1


   INSTALLATION


   Install OS/2 and the Communications Manager according to instructions
   in the documentation provided with the product.  When installing the
   Communications Manager, use its full function installation procedure.
   The 3270 Emulation and File Transfer feature groups of the
   Communications Manager need to be installed.  Installation of these
   features will copy the SRPI API structures, macros and object files to
   the Communications Manager directory, which is \CMLIB.

   The compiler associated with the desired language also needs to be
   installed using the installation procedure of that language compiler.
   Refer to the following language sections for additional information.

   INSTALL SAMPLE SRPI SERVER:


   To set up the sample server environment, two files are needed on the
   IBM host computer:

      IBMABASE MODULE (the sample server)
      INPUT FILE (the sample customer data set)

   The following instructions will guide you to properly install the SRPI
   sample server on the host.

   From the "Communications Manager Main Menu", start the 3270 emulation
   feature and log on to the specified session.  Create a new screen
   group from the Program Selector menu on the PC.  At the OS/2 command
   prompt, enter the following commands to upload the three host sample
   files from the diskette:

      SEND A:IBMABASE.ASM TEST: IBMABASE ASSEMBLE A (ASCII CRLF RECFM F
      SEND A:ALGABASE.EXC TEST: ALGABASE EXEC A (ASCII CRLF
      SEND A:INPUT.FIL TEST: INPUT FILE A (LRECL 109

   Note: If the above files are not located on a diskette in drive A,
   then enter the correct path inplace of the A:.

   After the file transfer completes, switch to the same 3270 session and
   type ALGABASE at the VM/CMS command line to assemble and link.  This
   will generate the executable sample server file with the name of
   IBMABASE MODULE.






























                                                                        7


   RUNNING SRPI REQUESTER AND SERVER SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   Create a new directory SAMPLE on the PC where your requester sample
   program will reside.  For C language, copy the file CSAMPL.EXE from
   C:\IBMC2 to C:\SAMPLE subdirectory.  For PASCAL, copy the file PSAMPL.EXE
   from C:\PASCAL to C:\SAMPLE subdirectory.  For MASM, copy the file
   MSAMPL.EXE from C:\MASM\BIN to C:\SAMPLE subdirectory.  For COBOL, copy
   the file BSAMPL.EXE form C:\PCOBOL\SRC to C:\SAMPLE subdirectory.

   Enter CMSSERV from the CMS command line in the 3270 session you just
   started.  The IBM Enhanced Connectivity Facilities screen appears.
   Switch to an OS/2 screen group and change the current directory to
   SAMPLE.  Execute the sample requester program.  When the program
   completes, switch back to the 3270 session with CMSSERV screen.  Press
   PF3 key to end the communication between CMSSERV and your PC.  Verify
   that there are two files generated in your 3270 session as a result of
   the SRPI requester execution.  The names of these two files are OUTPUT
   FILE and LOG FILE.

   The content of the OUTPUT FILE is listed below:
