  X.25 SAMPLE APPLICATION

  The X.25 sample application consists of programs that demonstrate the use of
  the X.25 interface verbs. The function of the sample application is to
  transmit data, using the X.25 protocol, from one PS/2 and receive that data
  on the same or a different PS/2.  To support this function, the sample appli-
  cation consists of two programs.  One is a receive program, which is referred
  to as the receiver side.  The other is a transmit program, which is referred
  to as the transmitter side.  On the receiver side, a user starts the receiver
  program, supplying a routing table entry name that has been created in the
  configuration file used to start Communictions Manager.  On the transmitter
  side, a user starts the transmitter program, supplying a directory entry name
  that has been created in the configuration file used to start Communictions
  Manager.

  The sample programs are designed to work in the OS/2 protected mode, with the
  Communications Manager of the OS/2 Extended Services.  The sample program
  source code and the supporting files are for C and MASM languages.

  PREREQUISITES

  To run the sample program, a user must be familiar with the following things:
